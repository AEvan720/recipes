    <h3>Starting with a simple classic</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your favorite peanut butter</li>
        <li>Your favorite honey</li>
        <li>Your bread of choice</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take out the amount of slices you want. Obviously a traditional sandwich is 2 slices, but if you're running low on bread you can take a single slice and fold it in half at the end</li>
        <li>Next we add the peanut butter to one side of each slice or the single slice. As a PB lover, I make sure to cover every inch I can.</li>
        <li>It's honey time. I prefer a figure 8 pattern on each slice aiming for the middle. You want to be careful putting honey towards the corners where it can leak out</li>
        <li>Finally it's time to close our sandwich. If you're using 2 slices, place one on top of the other so the peanut butter sides are facing each other. If you are only using one slice, simply fold it in half.</li>
    </ol>
