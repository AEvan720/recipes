    <h3>Breakfast, brunch, or dinner; french toast is as versitile as it is easy to make and delicious to eat</h3>
    <h2>Ingriedents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8 slices of a thick cut, preferably starting to go stale bread</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons of butter, for the cooking surface</li>
        <li>vanilla extract, nutmeg, and ground cinammon to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>A note on the last ingredients, I find a lot of recipes really undersell how much vanilla extract or seasonings to add regardless of the food.
        To that end, I find its easier to "eyeball" these ingredients yourself and refine the amount added over time.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, measure and add the flour</li>
        <li>While whisking, add the milk, eggs, and sugar. Keep whisking until the mixture is smooth and all the eggs yolks have been integrated in</li>
        <li>Add vanilla extract, nutmeg, and cinammon to the mixture. Whisk until the mixture is uniform</li>
        <li>Put a pan or gridle over medium heat and melt the butter. Spread the melted butter over the cooking surface</li>
        <li>While the pan is heating up, put the first piece(s) of bread into the mixture and coat both sides with batter</li>
        <li>Transfer the piece(s) of bread to the pan and cook each side for 2-4 minutes depending on preference</li>
        <li>While the first slices are cooking, transfer the next slice(s) to the batter</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 5-7 until you run out of batter or bread, whichever comes first</li>
        <li>After the last slices are done,its time to serve. You can add your own fruit, chocolate chips, or stick with classic butter and syrup</li>
    </ol>
