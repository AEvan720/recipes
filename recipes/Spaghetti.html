        <h3>A dish that seems simple at first, but can take some time to truly master</h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6-12 ounces of spaghetti</li>
            <li>A jar of your preferred sauce (Yes, its not as good as homemade, we're going for efficiency not a Michelin Star)</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt for the water</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan</li>
            <li>Oregano/Italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. A general rule is 3 quarts of water per 1 pound of pasta, 
                but really you just need enough water to cover the pasta you'll be adding</li>
            <li>While waiting for the water to boil, add your sauce to a separate pan at medium heat. We're going to let it simmer while the pasta cooks</li>
            <li>After the water in the pot reaches a <em>rolling</em> boil, add your spaghetti. Make sure to stir occasionally while the pasta is cooking. 
                I find that most "recommended" cook times for pasta overshoot it by 1-2 minutes, so subtract a minute from the recommended time and start testing the consistency about a minute before your new cook time is up</li>
            <li>Now we have time to spruce up our store bought sauce. The best additions I've found is adding your own oregano/Italain seasoning to taste, and mixing in some parmesan into the sauce itself </li>
            <li>After the pasta has reached your desired consistency, it's time to strain it. Be sure to save a small amount of the water for the next step</li> 
            <li>After straining the pasta, transfer it to the same pan as your sauce. Coat the pasta in the sauce, then add a little bit of your saved pasta water.
                The starch from the water will help the sauce stick to your pasta</li>
            <li>Now its time to crank up the heat. Raise the temperature of the burner the sauce pan is on to high, and while continously stirring the pasta around let the heat cause the excess moisture from the sauce to evaporate.
                This will give your sauce more of a homemade/restaurant style consistency.</li>   
        </ol>
